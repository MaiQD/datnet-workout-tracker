## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Purpose of this Document

This document outlines the high-level business and user requirements for **dotFitness**, a web-based application designed to support individuals in tracking and customizing their home workout routines. It serves as a foundational agreement on the application's scope and functionalities from a non-technical perspective.

### 1.2. UI Design Goals (Updated)

The core UI design goals for **dotFitness** are:

- **Motivating & Engaging:** Inspire users to continue their fitness journey through positive reinforcement, visual progress, and an energetic aesthetic.
- **Clear & Uncluttered:** Provide a clean interface with minimal distractions, especially during active workout sessions.
- **Intuitive & Easy to Use:** Ensure a smooth learning curve for users to navigate, create, log, and track their workouts efficiently.
- **Visually Guided:** Leverage visual aids like exercise videos and clear data visualizations to enhance understanding and engagement.
- **Responsive:** Adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) for flexibility in home workout environments.
- **Action-Oriented:** Guide users towards key functionalities with prominent and well-labeled calls to action.
- **Themable:** Allow users to switch between a light and dark visual theme based on preference.
- **Secure Access:** Enforce authenticated access for all core application features.

### 1.3. Target Audience (UI/UX Focus)

For the "at-home active" user, the UI must compensate for the lack of a physical trainer by providing clear guidance, strong motivation, and streamlined logging. Users may interact with the app on various devices, from a laptop to a smartphone, so responsiveness and touch-friendly elements are crucial.

## 2. Visual Design Guidelines

### 2.1. Color Palette (Updated for Theming)

The color palette will be clean, modern, and energetic, designed to inspire motivation and focus. It will have distinct variations for light and dark themes.

- **Primary Accent:** A vibrant, athletic blue or green (e.g., `#007BFF` or `#28A745`) for main action buttons, highlights, and progress indicators. This color will be consistently used across both themes.
- **Secondary Accent:** A complementary, slightly softer color (e.g., a warm orange `#FFC107` or light purple `#6F42C1`) for secondary actions or specific data visualization.
- **Neutral Palette (Theme-Dependent):**
    - **Light Theme:**
        - Backgrounds: Light grays (`#F8F9FA`, `#E9ECEF`) to provide a clean canvas.
        - Text: Dark grays to black (`#343A40`, `#212529`) for high readability.
        - Borders/Dividers: Subtle grays (`#DEE2E6`).
    - **Dark Theme:**
        - Backgrounds: Dark grays to black (`#212529`, `#343A40`) to reduce eye strain.
        - Text: Light grays to white (`#F8F9FA`, `#E9ECEF`) for readability against dark backgrounds.
        - Borders/Dividers: Darker, subtle grays (`#495057`).
- **Status Colors:**
    - Success: Green (`#28A745`)
    - Warning: Yellow/Orange (`#FFC107`)
    - Error: Red (`#DC3545`)
    - These will maintain consistency across both themes for immediate recognition.

### 2.2. Typography

Clean, modern, and highly readable sans-serif fonts will be used, ensuring good contrast in both light and dark themes.

- **Headings (H1-H6):** A bold, impactful sans-serif font (e.g., `Inter`, `Montserrat`) for titles and key metrics to convey strength and clarity.
- **Body Text:** A highly readable sans-serif font (e.g., `Open Sans`, `Roboto`) for descriptions, instructions, and general content.
- **Numerical Data:** Potentially a monospace or specific font for numbers in progress charts to enhance precision.

### 2.3. Iconography

- **Style:** Clean, minimalist line icons with a consistent stroke weight. Icons should adapt to theme colors (e.g., light icons on dark backgrounds, dark icons on light backgrounds).
- **Source:** Potentially a library like Google Material Icons or Font Awesome for common actions (e.g., edit, delete, play, add, check).
- **Usage:** Used to quickly convey meaning, especially in navigation and action buttons.

### 2.4. Imagery & Illustrations

- **Style:** Minimalist, geometric, and encouraging illustrations where used. Photos should be high-quality, diverse, and depict active individuals in home environments.
- **Purpose:** To break up content, provide visual interest, and reinforce motivation.
- **Consideration:** Images should be chosen or adapted to look good in both light and dark modes, potentially using transparent backgrounds or subtle overlays.

### 2.5. Overall Aesthetic

**dotFitness** will embody a **clean, modern, and energetic** aesthetic. Whitespace will be used generously to reduce cognitive load. Cards and subtle shadows will help organize content. Positive and encouraging micro-copy will be integrated throughout the UI. The aesthetic will be maintained across both the light and dark themes, with careful adjustments to background, text, and accent colors to ensure visual harmony and readability.

## 3. Layout and Navigation

### 3.1. Responsive Layout

The design will be built mobile-first using Tailwind CSS's utility classes.

- **Small Screens (Mobile):** Primary navigation via a bottom navigation bar or a hamburger menu toggling a full-screen overlay. Content will be stacked vertically. Critical workout session elements will fill the screen.
- **Medium Screens (Tablet):** Content may flow into two columns. Navigation potentially via a collapsible sidebar.
- **Large Screens (Desktop):** Consistent sidebar navigation (always visible). Multi-column layouts for dashboards and lists.

### 3.2. Main Navigation

- **Sidebar Navigation (Desktop/Tablet):** A persistent left-hand sidebar containing primary links:
    - Dashboard
    - My Exercises
    - My Routines
    - Workout History
    - Progress
    - Profile/Settings
    - Admin (if applicable)
- **Bottom Navigation Bar (Mobile):** For quick access to primary sections.
- **Top Bar:** Contains app logo, user profile avatar/dropdown, and potentially global search or notifications. This is also where the **Theme Toggle** will likely reside.

## 6. Component-Based Design (Vue.js & Tailwind CSS)

The UI will be built using Vue.js's component-based architecture.

- **Vue Components:** Each distinct UI element (e.g., `Button`, `InputField`, `Card`), and each major section (e.g., `WorkoutSession`, `ExerciseForm`, `ProgressChart`), will be encapsulated as a reusable Vue component.

- **Chart.js Integration:** Chart.js will be used within dedicated Vue components (e.g., `WeightTrendChart.vue`) by passing data as props to the Chart.js instances, ensuring reactive updates. Chart colors will be adjusted based on the active theme.

## 7. Special UI/UX Considerations

### 7.1. Authentication State & Access (New)

- **Default State:** Upon opening the application, users will land directly on the **Welcome/Login Screen (4.0)**.
- **Protected Routes:** All other application routes (Dashboard, Exercises, Routines, etc.) will be protected. If an unauthenticated user attempts to access a protected route, they will be redirected to the Login Screen.
- **Backend Protection:** All API endpoints will be protected by authentication and authorization middleware, ensuring no unauthorized data access or manipulation.
- **UI Feedback:** A loading spinner may appear briefly during authentication redirects.

### 7.2. Theming (Dark and Light Theme) (New)

- **Mechanism:** Users will have the option to switch between a **Light Theme** (default) and a **Dark Theme**.
- **Theme Toggle:** A prominent toggle (e.g., a sun/moon icon) will be present in the application's top navigation bar or user profile settings.
- **Persistence:** The user's theme preference will be saved (e.g., in `localStorage`) and automatically applied on subsequent visits.
- **Visual Impact:**
    - **Backgrounds:** Will shift from light colors to dark grays/blacks.
    - **Text Colors:** Will invert to maintain readability (dark text on light, light text on dark).
    - **Accent Colors:** Primary and secondary accent colors will remain consistent but may have slight luminance adjustments to pop appropriately on the new backgrounds.
    - **Chart Colors:** Chart elements (lines, bars, text, grids) will adapt their colors to be clearly visible and harmonious within the active theme.
    - **Icons/Illustrations:** Will be chosen or styled to appear well in both themes.
- **Implementation:** Tailwind CSS's built-in `dark:` variant will be extensively used for styling. A root class on the `<html>` element (e.g., `dark`) will control the active theme.
